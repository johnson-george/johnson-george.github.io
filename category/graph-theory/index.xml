      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given any finite graph $G$, can we partition the vertex set $V = V_1 \cup V_2$ such that in the induced subgraphs $G[V_1]$, $G[V_2]$ every vertex has even degree? If every degree in the original graph is even, we are done, since we can take $V_1 = V$, $V_2 = \varnothing$. We can suppose therefore that at least one vertex in $G$ has odd degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is natural to attempt to prove this result by induction, on the number of vertices in $G$ perhaps. So suppose $|G| = n$ and that the result is true for graphs of order $n-1$. We can remove a vertex $v$ from $G$ and use the inductive hypothesis to partition the remaining vertices so that they all have even degree in their respective subgraphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difficulty comes when we reintroduce $v$. Suppose we assign $v$ to the subset $V_1$. Then any neighbours of $v$ in $V_1$ will gain an extra edge, and hence have odd degree. We can therefore only preserve the even degree condition if one of the two subsets contains no neighbours of $v$. But there seems to be no way to arrange for this in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-idea&#34;&gt;An Idea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem, at a glance, that an inductive argument is not appropriate in this case. However, we have not used the full might of the inductive hypothesis, which states that the result is true for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; graphs of order $n-1$, not just $G - v$. We may thus hope to construct and then partition a different graph $G&amp;rsquo;$ of order $n-1$, such that when we reintroduce $v$ &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; pass back to the original set of edges, the degrees of the vertices are unchanged (modulo two, at least).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first note that $v$ itself must have even degree in the subgraph it eventually belongs to. We can ensure this by choosing $v$ to be a vertex of odd degree in $G$ (as noted above, such a choice is possible without loss of generality). Then $v$ must have an even number of neighbours in either $V_1$ or $V_2$ &amp;mdash; let&amp;rsquo;s say it&amp;rsquo;s $V_1$ &amp;mdash; and we can hence choose to reintroduce $v$ to $V_1$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, how can we contruct the graph $G&amp;rsquo;$ we speculated about above? Since reintroducing $v$ introduces an extra edge to each of its neighbours in $V_1$, we would like to construct a graph such that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any neighbour of $v$ in $V_1$ has a different degree modulo two in $(G-v)[V_1]$ and $G&amp;rsquo;[V_1]$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any neighbour of $v$ in $V_2$ has the same degree modulo two in $(G-v)[V_2]$ and $G&amp;rsquo;[V_2]$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks a little tricky, since the partition $V_1 \cup V_2$ we take will depend on the graph $G&amp;rsquo;$ we construct. Denote the neighbours of $v$ by $\Gamma(v)$ and focus on the graph $G[\Gamma(v)]$. Restrict the partitions to these vertices: $W_i = V_i \cap \Gamma(v)$. We know that $|W_1|$ is even and $|W_2|$ is odd. Consider therefore that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$w \in W_1$ has a different number of neighbours and non-neighbours (modulo two) in $G[W_1]$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$w \in W_2$ has the same number of neighbours and non-neighbours (modulo two) in $G[W_2]$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An idea now presents itself: delete every edge in $G[\Gamma(v)]$ and introduce an edge wherever there wasn&amp;rsquo;t one. Such a construction is known as the &lt;strong&gt;complement&lt;/strong&gt; of the graph $G[\Gamma(v)]$. By virtue of the above two facts, we have hereby changed the degree of every vertex in $G[W_1]$ and left unchanged the degree of every vertex in $G[W_2]$ (modulo two). This remains true when we reattach the rest of the graph $G-v$. But this is precisely what we wanted to achieve!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-proof&#34;&gt;A Proof&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us put these ideas together. Given a graph $G$ of order $n$, choose a vertex $v$ of odd degree (if no such vertex exists, we are done). From $G-v$ construct the graph $G&amp;rsquo;$ by deleting edges between those elements $v_1, v_2$ of $\Gamma(v)$ with $v_1 v_2 \in E(G)$ and introducing edges between those elements $v_1, v_2$ of $\Gamma(v)$ with $v_1 v_2 \notin E(G)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apply the inductive hypothesis to $G&amp;rsquo;$. Suppose that $v$ has an even number of neighbours in $V_1$ (if not, it has an even number of neighbours in $V_2$). Then the subsets $V_1 \cup \{ v \}$ and $V_2$ consitute a partition of $V$ such that every vertex in the induced subgraphs has even degree .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proof is completed by noting that the result is clearly true for $n=1$.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Utilities Problem on General Compact Surfaces</title>
      <link>/blog/utilities/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well known that one cannot connect each of three homes to each of three utilities, without any of the lines of connection crossing, if those lines are restricted to lie in a plane (or equivalently, on the surface of a sphere). Mathematically, we say that the complete bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$ is not planar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible to draw such a graph on the surface of a torus. Indeed, on a torus it is possible to connect each of four homes to each of four utilities, without any lines of connection crossing (an exercise for the curious).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A natural question to ask is: what is the surface of lowest genus $g$ on which it is possible to connect $n$ homes to $n$ utilities, without crossings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-lower-bound&#34;&gt;A Lower Bound&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a lower bound on the genus required. Suppose the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ can be drawn without crossings on the genus-$g$ surface. Let $e = n^2$ denote the number of edges in the graph, $f$ the number of faces, and let $\chi = 2 - 2g$ denote the Euler characteristic of the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shortest cycle in $K_{n,n}$ has length four. Thus each face of the graph must have at least four sides, and since each side is shared by two faces, we must have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ 2 e \geq 4 f  \ .$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By definition, we have $2n - e + f = \chi$. Thus we can write the above inequality as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ \frac{e}{2} \leq 2n - \chi = 2(n + g - 1) \ .$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus we find that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ g \geq \frac{(n-2)^2}{4} \ . $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-upper-bound&#34;&gt;An Upper Bound&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that any finite graph can be drawn without crossings on a surface with sufficiently large genus. Roughly speaking, we can simply send each edge through its own handle, and so $g \leq e(G)$ gives a simple upper bound on the genus required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve this bound, first consider the case that $n = 2m$ is even. By considering the houses in pairs, and likewise for the utilities, our task is to connect each house pair to each utility pair with a copy of $K_{2,2}$, of which there will be $m^2$ in total. Note that we can represent a $K_{2,2}$ passing through a handle like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;pics/k22.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus we can clearly draw our graph with $m^2$ handles like so ($m = 2$):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;pics/simple.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here black dots indicate houses and white dots indicate utilities. This gives a simple upper bound (for $n$ odd or even) on the genus of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$g \leq \lceil n/2 \rceil^2 \ .$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-better-upper-bound&#34;&gt;A Better Upper Bound&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us pair the houses and utilities as before. We can easily draw $m$ copies of $K_{2,2}$ on the plane like so ($m=3$):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;pics/bound1.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, we can add $m-1$ further copies of $K_{2,2}$ without difficulty:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;pics/bound2.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now claim that we can add the remaining $(m-1)^2$ copies of $K_{2,2}$ using $(m-1)^2$ handles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;pics/bound3.png&#34; width=&#34;400&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our minimum required genus is hence bounded above by $g \leq (m-1)^2 = (n-2)^2/4$. But this is precisely the lower bound on the genus we previously found!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For $n$ odd I have not found so neat a solution. It seems clear that the genus required should be smaller than that for $K_{n+1,n+1}$, yet it may not be possible to achieve the lower bound described above (for one thing, it is impossible for every face to have four sides, since the number of edges is odd). More thought is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-partial-solution&#34;&gt;A Partial Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have found that when $n$ is even, the minimum genus required to draw $K_{n,n}$ without crossings is
$$ g = \frac{(n-2)^2}{4} \ . $$
Whilst for $n$ odd, we have found that this minimum genus lies in the range
$$ (n/2 - 1)^2 \leq g \leq (\lceil n/2 \rceil - 1)^2 \ .$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides pinning down the case of odd $n$ precisely, a natural next question to ask is how this result extends to the graphs $K_{m,n}$ for $m \neq n$.&lt;/p&gt;
