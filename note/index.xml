      <title>Geometry and Calculus Practice Paper</title>
      <link>/note/maths_collection/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/notes/geom_calc_collection_jan_2021.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Geometry and Calculus Paper.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I taught applied mathematics to first year undergraduates at Oxford during the 2020-2021 academic year. The focus of the first term was geometry and calculus, and I wrote a practice paper for the students to sit in January that covered this material. My aim was to set problems that involved little in the way of bookwork, and which required the application of the ideas of the course to unfamiliar scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Algebraic Topology Solutions</title>
      <link>/note/hatcher/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/notes/hatcher_chapter0_solutions.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Chapter 0 Solutions.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are my solutions to the problems in Chapter 0 of Allen Hatcher&amp;rsquo;s Algebraic Topology. Most questions I solved independently, although for some of the trickier problems I referred to answers on math.stackexchange.com. There are almost certainly several errors, and I would appreciate being notified of any mistakes spotted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>General Relativity Practice Paper</title>
      <link>/note/gr_collection/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/notes/b5_collection_may_2021.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;General Relativity Paper.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I taught General Relativity to third year undergraduate students at Oxford for six years. During this period I wrote a practice paper that the students would usually sit in late April. I hope it provides good practice at a range of problems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Schwartz Errata</title>
      <link>/note/schwartz/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/notes/schwartz_errata_may_2021.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Schwartz Errata.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Schwartz keeps a list of corrections for QFT and the Standard Model on &lt;a href=&#34;https://schwartzqft.fas.harvard.edu/corrections&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the book&amp;rsquo;s website&lt;/a&gt;. I noticed very few errors from earlier parts of the book that were absent from this list, but in later chapters I found significantly more which hadn&amp;rsquo;t been recorded. I have made my best attempt to log them here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nakahara Errata</title>
      <link>/note/nakahara/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/note/nakahara/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/notes/nakahara_errata_may_2021.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Nakahara Errata.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of my PhD I worked my way through the first 12 chapters of Geometry, Topology and Physics by Mikio Nakahara. The book is my personal recommendation for any theoretical physicist wanting a modern and comprehensive overview of the main results of differential geometry and algebraic topology. There are, however, numerous typos and small errors, and I have made my best attempt to log them here.&lt;/p&gt;
